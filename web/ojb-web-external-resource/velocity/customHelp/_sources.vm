<br/><br/>
When performing queries, the user must first designate which source system(s) will be searched. These systems are provided by HIJIS participating agencies.
<br/><br/>
Each source system provides their own data set, allowing users to search with applicable parameters. The sub-topics will cover the basics of what is available on each system.
<br/><br/>
If the user is not authorized to access a system based on agency-defined access control rules, the system will be displayed in low-light and not selectable.
