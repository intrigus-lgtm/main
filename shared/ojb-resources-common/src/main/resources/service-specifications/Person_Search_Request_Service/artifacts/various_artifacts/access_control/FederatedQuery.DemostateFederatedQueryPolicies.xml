<xacml3:PolicySet xmlns:xacml3="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17"

    <xacml3:Description>The executive steering committee of the Demostate Information Sharing and Manipulation Environment (DIS-ME) met
    this week and established the following access control rules for the federated query in Demostate.  (Actually, upon
    SEARCHÕs advice to use a Òpolicy-drivenÓ governance model, the Demostate Association of Police Chiefs and Sheriffs, the
    Demostate Highway Patrol, and the Supreme Court of  Demostate have agreed to publish policies for the incident, criminal history,
    and warrant data, respectivelyÉthe executive steering committee just reviewed and accepted these policies at their meeting.)
    
    The rules are:
    
    1.	Incident data is available to anyone
    2.	Juvenile criminal history data (i.e., where the subject is currently under the age of 18) is only available to court
    personnel and the sheriffÕs office in the offenderÕs county of residence; otherwise, criminal history data is available to any criminal justice agency user
    3.	Warrant data is available to any criminal justice agency user who has taken the judiciaryÕs 1-day Òwarrant information safeguardingÓ training
    
    Our job is to:
    
    1.	Produce ALFA and XACML policy rule set(s) for these rules
    2.	Write XSLTs to create the XACML requests from the appropriate SOAP requests that exist now
    3.	Define and implement SAML assertion requirements for the Demostate environment</xacml3:Description>
